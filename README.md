# Semantic Search

Semantic search systems enhance traditional search mechanisms by understanding the intent and contextual meaning of the user's query. This project demonstrates how to build and integrate a semantic search system using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## How to Run

To get started with the semantic search system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use Jupyter Lab.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing `semantic_search.ipynb`.
3. Run `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` and open `semantic_search.ipynb` from the interface.
4. Execute the cells in sequence to see the semantic search in action.

## What's Included

This project includes the following files:

- `semantic_search.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code necessary for setting up, running, and testing the semantic search model.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python libraries required for the project.

## Lessons Learned

### API Integration: 

- **Semantic Search Engines**: How to leverage semantic search APIs to understand the context and meaning behind queries.
- **Tokenizer Usage**: The role of tokenizers in processing natural language data, preparing it for semantic analysis.

## Questions/Uncertainties

- How can the search results' relevance be further improved?
- What are the scalability challenges when applying this model to larger datasets?
- How does the choice of tokenizer affect the accuracy and efficiency of the search?

## Future Enhancements

- Explore different machine learning models to enhance search accuracy.
- Implement additional features such as auto-complete suggestions based on semantic relevance.
- Investigate the impact of different tokenization techniques on search performance.
